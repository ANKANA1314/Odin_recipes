    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Chai, also known as masala chai, is a traditional Indian tea that has
      gained popularity worldwide. It is a flavorful and aromatic beverage made
      by brewing black tea with a blend of aromatic spices and herbs. The
      typical spices used in chai include cardamom, cinnamon, ginger, cloves,
      and black peppercorns, but the recipe can vary regionally and based on
      personal preferences.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Tea</li>
      <li>Spices</li>
      <li>Milk</li>
      <li>Sweetner</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Boil Water: Fill a kettle or saucepan with fresh, cold water and bring it to a boil. 
        The amount of water will depend on how many cups of tea you want to make.</li>
      <li>Warm the Teapot or Cup: While the water is boiling, you can warm your teapot or cup by rinsing it with hot water and then discarding the water.</li>
      <li>Add the Tea Bag: Place one tea bag into the teapot or cup. If you prefer stronger tea, you can add more tea bags or adjust the steeping time later.</li>
      <li>Pour the Hot Water: Once the water has reached a rolling boil, carefully pour it over the tea bag(s) in the teapot or cup.</li>
      <li>Steep the Tea: Let the tea steep for the appropriate time, usually 3 to 5 minutes for black tea and 2 to 3 minutes for green tea. 
        If you prefer a stronger flavor, you can steep it for a little longer, but be careful not to over-steep as it can result in a bitter taste.</li>
      <li>Add Milk (Optional): If you like your tea with milk, you can add a splash of milk to your cup. 
        The amount of milk will depend on your preference, so you can adjust it to achieve your desired taste.</li>
      <li>Add Sweetener (Optional): If you prefer your tea sweetened, you can add sugar, honey, or any other sweetener of your choice. 
        Start with a small amount and adjust to your taste.</li>
      <li>Stir: Give the tea a gentle stir to mix the milk and sweetener evenly, if added.</li>
      <li>Remove the Tea Bag: Once the tea has steeped to your liking, remove the tea bag from the cup using a spoon or by lifting it with the string attached.</li>
      <li>Enjoy: Your cup of tea is now ready! Sit back, relax, and savor the delightful flavors of your freshly brewed tea.</li>
