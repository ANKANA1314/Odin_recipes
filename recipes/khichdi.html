    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Wash and soak the rice and dal: Rinse the rice and dal together under
        cold water until the water runs clear. Then, soak them in water for
        about 30 minutes. This step is optional but can help reduce the cooking
        time.
      </li>
      <li>
        Prepare the vegetables (if using): Chop the mixed vegetables into small
        pieces. You can use a combination of carrots, peas, cauliflower, or any
        other vegetables you like.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a pressure cooker or a large pot, heat ghee or oil over medium heat.
        Add cumin seeds and mustard seeds (if using). Let them splutter and
        release their aroma. Add chopped onions (if using) and sauté until they
        turn golden brown. Stir in the grated ginger and slit green chilies.
        Sauté for a minute or until the raw smell disappears. Add the chopped
        tomatoes and cook until they become soft and mushy. Drain the soaked
        rice and dal and add them to the pot. Mix well with the sautéed
        ingredients. Add turmeric powder, asafoetida, and salt to taste. Mix
        everything together. Pour in 3 cups of water and add the chopped
        vegetables (if using). Stir well to combine.
      </li>

        If using a pressure cooker, close the lid and cook on medium heat for 2
        whistles. Then, reduce the heat to low and let it cook for another 5
        minutes. Turn off the heat and allow the pressure to release naturally
      </li>
      <li>Once the khichdi is cooked, gently fluff it with a fork. Garnish with fresh coriander leaves.</li>
