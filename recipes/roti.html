    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Roti is a traditional Indian flatbread that holds a special place in the
        hearts and meals of people across the country. It is a staple food in
        India and is widely enjoyed as a versatile accompaniment to various
        curries, vegetables, and lentil dishes.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>whole wheat flour</li>
        <li>water</li>
        <li>salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Mix the Flour and Salt: In a mixing bowl, combine the whole wheat flour
            and a pinch of salt. Mix the dry ingredients together using a spoon or
            your fingers.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add Water Gradually: Slowly add water to the flour mixture, a little at
            a time, while kneading the dough with your hand. Continue adding water
            until you achieve a soft and smooth dough. The exact amount of water
            needed may vary, so be careful not to add too much water at once.
        </li>
        <li>
            Knead the Dough: Once the dough starts coming together, transfer it to a
            clean surface and knead it for about 5-7 minutes. The kneading process
            helps develop gluten in the dough, which makes the roti soft and
            elastic. The dough should not be too sticky or too dry.
        </li>
        <li>Rest the Dough: Cover the dough with a damp cloth or place it in a covered bowl. Allow it to rest for about
            15-20 minutes. This resting period relaxes the gluten and makes the dough easier to work with.</li>
        <li>Divide the Dough: After resting, divide the dough into small, equal-sized balls. The size of the balls will
            determine the size of your rotis.</li>
        <li>Roll the Roti: Take one dough ball and flatten it slightly with your palm. Dip it into dry flour and then
            use a rolling pin to roll it into a thin, round disc. Rotate the roti frequently while rolling to maintain
            an even shape.</li>
        <li>Cook the Roti: Heat a tawa (flat griddle) or a non-stick pan over medium heat. Place the rolled roti on the
            hot tawa and cook it for about 30 seconds to 1 minute on one side. You will notice small bubbles forming on
            the surface.</li>
        <li>Flip and Cook: Once you see bubbles, flip the roti to the other side using tongs or a spatula. Cook for
            another 30 seconds to 1 minute, pressing lightly with a cloth or spatula to help it puff up.</li>
        <li>Cook Over Open Flame (Optional): If you prefer, you can finish cooking the roti directly over an open flame.
            Using tongs, place the partially cooked roti on the flame. It will puff up and develop a slight char on the
            surface. Be careful not to burn it.</li>
        <li>Brush with Ghee or Oil (Optional): For added flavor, you can brush the cooked roti with ghee or oil on one
            side.</li>
        <li>Repeat: Repeat the rolling and cooking process for the remaining dough balls until you have made all the
            rotis.</li>
        <li>Serve: Serve the hot and freshly cooked rotis with your favorite curry, vegetable dish, or any other
            accompaniment of your choice.</li>
    </ol>
