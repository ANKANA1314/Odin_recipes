    <ul>
        <li>massoor dal</li>
        <li>salt</li>
        <li>oil</li>
        <li>cumin seeds</li>
        <li>asafoetida</li>
        <li>onions</li>
        <li>curry leaves</li>
        <li>garlic</li>
        <li>tomatoes</li>
        <li>chilly powder</li>
        <li>coriander</li>
        <li>ginder-green chilli powder</li>
        <li>tumeric powder</li>
        <li>chopped corianders</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse and Soak Masoor Dal (Optional): Rinse the masoor dal under cold water until the water runs clear.
            Soak the dal in water for about 30 minutes. This step is optional but can help reduce the cooking time.</li>
        <li>Pressure Cook or Stovetop Cooking: In a pressure cooker or a large pot, add the soaked masoor dal and 3 cups
            of water (or 4 cups if cooking on the stovetop).
            If using a pressure cooker, cover it with the lid and cook on medium heat for 2 whistles. If cooking on the
            stovetop, bring the dal to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and simmer until the lentils are soft and
            cooked thoroughly (approximately 20-25 minutes). Stir occasionally to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li>Prepare the Tadka (Tempering): In a separate pan, heat vegetable oil or ghee over medium heat. Add cumin
            seeds and mustard seeds. Let them splutter and release their aroma.</li>
        <li>Add Aromatics: Add the finely chopped onions to the pan and sauté until they turn golden brown. Then, add
            the minced garlic (if using), grated ginger, and slit green chilies. Sauté for a minute or until the raw
            smell disappears.</li>
        <li>Add Tomatoes and Spices: Stir in the chopped tomatoes and cook until they become soft and mushy. Add
            turmeric powder, red chili powder, and salt to taste. Mix well and cook for another minute.</li>
        <li>Combine Dal and Tadka: Once the lentils are cooked, mash them slightly with a spoon or ladle to get a creamy
            texture. Then, pour the prepared tadka (tempering) into the dal and mix everything together.</li>
        <li>Simmer: Let the dal simmer on low heat for a few minutes to allow the flavors to meld together. If the dal
            is too thick, you can add more water to achieve the desired consistency.

            Optional: Add garam masala for extra flavor. Adjust salt and spices according to your taste preference.</li>
        <li>Garnish and Serve: Turn off the heat and garnish the masoor dal with fresh coriander leaves. Serve hot with
            steamed rice, naan, or any Indian flatbread. Optionally, serve with lemon wedges for a tangy kick.</li>
